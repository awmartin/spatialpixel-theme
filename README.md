## Description

Spatial Pixel is a clean theme designed for readability amidst a sleek, sans-serif look. The home and archive pages are designed for fast perusal and skimming, while the single pages are built for long reads.

## Features

**Post types.** For quotes, for example, include a file `single-quote.php` and fill it out with a Null template, like copying `single-standard.php`.

**Featured images.** A post's feature image shows up in the home and archive pages as a thumbnail in the smaller entry. It's also featured at the top of the single page.

**Sticky posts.** Sticky posts on the front page are displayed large at the top. I recommend you use only one sticky post.

**Highlighted first paragraph.** Put a `<!--more-->` tag after the first paragraph in a post or page, and that paragraph will show up as the page's excerpt in index and archive pages.

**Meta description.** Includes code to set the `<meta name="description">` tag in the `<head>` automatically to the page's excerpt or the site's description.
